Program to automatically generate Anki Japanese vocabulary flash cards

This has been set up to use Google Cloud TTS. This service does require an account, but is the best I could find for this purpose, and is currently free for the first 4 Million characters of speech generated.

If you do not wish to connect a Google Cloud account to this program, my intention is to allow account-free, local execution of the program, but your flash cards may not have audio. This is all early development, so this is all subject to change.
